<h5> About Etheris</h5>
Located at the High Jung Institute of Technology, in the 17th dimension of innovation.

Welcome to Etheris — where the code is open, the snacks are fermented, and the future is flavored.

We're not your typical tech company. Nestled deep within the circuitous halls of the High Jung Institute of Technology, Etheris is a research-driven, cheese-powered, Linux-fueled, vegetable-enhanced software and hardware collective focused on pushing the boundaries of what’s possible — and what’s slightly absurd.

<h5> Built on Linux</h5>
At our core, we're powered by Linux — not just the OS, but the philosophy. Open, modular, a little rebellious, and incredibly efficient. Whether we're developing self-aware network protocols or cabbage-scented kernels, we do it the Free and Open Source way.

<h5> CheeseTech™</h5>
Our proprietary CheeseTech™ Stack harnesses the chemical wisdom of aged dairy to improve system entropy. (Don't ask how — it's a secret). All we’ll say is that our most stable releases coincided with a particularly good batch of cave-aged Gruyère.

<h5> CelerySync</h5>
You’ve heard of event-driven systems. You’ve heard of async. But have you heard of CelerySync™? Our revolutionary task queue framework, powered by fresh organic celery, schedules tasks, pipelines dreams, and occasionally makes soup.

<h5> CabbageNet</h5>
Etheris proudly runs its entire backend on CabbageNet, our decentralized, mesh-based networking protocol inspired by the intricate leaf layering of the noble cabbage. Secure, scalable, and slightly crunchy — it's the internet as nature intended.

<h5> Our Mission</h5>
To empower open-source technologists, philosophers, and vegetable engineers to dream big, code weird, and build systems that are just as sustainable as they are surreal.

<h5> Want to Join?</h5>
We’re never looking for more contributors, collaborators, and interdimensional time-salad theorists. Apply later via our encrypted carrier pigeon or email us at no-reply@google.com.
